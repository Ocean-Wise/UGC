# User Generated Content Approval App

This application aggregates public user created content from both Twitter and Instagram. The curator is able to 'Approve' content which then adds the post's information into a database. This database is then accessable from other platforms via an API.

This allows us to display only approved non-OW created social media content on our sites. This app was built specifically for the #BePlasticWise pledge.ocean.org website. It was not intended for long-term stability as the Instagram workaround is moderately hack-y.
